README:

to start, please open the pronountool.rpy file in the game folder.
you will need to copy it to the game folder of your own game to use it.

script.rpy & screen.rpy have examples of the tool in actual use.

everything else is just default ren'py.

for an example of the code in action,
put this project into your ren'py projects directory & launch it.
